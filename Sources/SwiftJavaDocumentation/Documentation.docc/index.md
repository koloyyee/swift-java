# ``SwiftJavaDocumentation``

The SwiftJava project enables interoperability between Swift and Java.

## Overview

This project contains a number of support packages, java libraries, tools and plugins that provide a complete
Swift and Java interoperability story.

Please refer to articles about the specific direction of interoperability you are interested in.

### Getting started

**SwiftJava** provides Java and Swift interoperability with minimal overhead. It eliminates the complex, error-prone process of manually compiling Java classes to C headers for native access. With SwiftJava, developers can achieve a flexible, safe, and high-performance connection between the two languages.

#### Interoperability promotes
- Incremental adoption of Swift
- Reuse of libraries
- Support for ecosystem-specific build tools

#### Tools
- Swift Package: 
    - JavaKit (Java -> Swift)
- Java Library: 
    - SwiftKit (Swift -> Java)
- Tooling: 
    - swift-java: command line tool 
    - Build tool integration: SwiftPM Plugin or Gradle
